    <History>
        Sennacherib described a battle with the Elamites: "At the command of the god Ashur, the great Lord, I rushed upon the enemy like the approach of a hurricane... I put them to rout and turned them back. I trasfixed the troops of the enemy with javelins and arrows." (Note: That a ruler talking only about himself and omitting the others that took part, was a typical characteristic for emperors over the course of history.)
