    <History>Hatshepsut is probably the most well-known of the female Egyptian Pharaohs; by rebuilding trade networks with Phoenicia and Israel that had been severed during the Hyksos occupation of Lower (northern) Egypt, she helped usher in the prosperity of the New Kingdom. Hatshepsut was probably the Queen of Sheba mentioned in the Scriptures as visiting King Solomon of Israel. She also appears to have led several successful military campaigns in Nubia. II Chronicles 9:1: 'And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.'</History>
