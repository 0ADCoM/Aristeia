    <History>Although ancient Egypt was male-dominated, women enjoyed more rights than in some other early civilizations. They could own property, borrow money, and sign contracts, initiate divorce, appear in court as a witness, were regarded as equal before the law, and were often referred to as “mistress of the house”. On a few occasions, women even became Pharaohs, although for the most part government jobs were held by men.</History>
